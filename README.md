Quick How-TO

Checkout the code I have posed here:
https://github.com/PureEngineering/c12666ma

Also get yourself an arduino uno if you don't have one already.

next download the arduino environment.

And for visulization you can use processing 
https://processing.org/download/?processing


put the spectrometer into the breakout board. 
alight the breakout board so the 5V and 3.3V and GND pins line up. EOS will be unconnected in the center. 
Download the code onto the arduino. 
you will have to modify the processing script to open the correct serial port.
